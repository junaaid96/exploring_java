These examples cover some of the fundamental concepts in Java.

## Arrays

File: `src/ArrayExample.java`

- Demonstrates how to declare, initialize, access, iterate, and modify elements in an array.

## Linked List

File: `src/LinkedListExample.java`

- Implements a simple linked list with a `Node` class and a `LinkedList` class.
- Includes methods to insert new nodes at the end of the list and display the entire list.

## Stack

File: `src/StackExample.java`

- Demonstrates how to create and use a stack using the `Stack` class from the Java Collections Framework.
- Includes operations such as push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.

## Queue

File: `src/QueueExample.java`

- Demonstrates how to create and use a queue using the `Queue` interface and `LinkedList` class from the Java Collections Framework.
- Includes operations such as add, remove, peek, and checking if the queue is empty.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

File: `src/BSTExample.java`

- Implements a simple binary search tree with a `TreeNode` class and a `BinarySearchTree` class.
- Includes methods to insert new nodes and perform in-order traversal.

## HashMap

File: `src/HashMapExample.java`

- Demonstrates how to create and use a `HashMap` from the Java Collections Framework.
- Includes operations such as adding key-value pairs, accessing values by key, iterating over entries, checking if a key exists, and removing key-value pairs.

## Sorting (Bubble Sort)

File: `src/BubbleSortExample.java`

- Implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
- Includes a method to perform the sorting and a main method to demonstrate the sorting process.

## Searching (Binary Search)

File: `src/BinarySearchExample.java`

- Implements the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array of integers.
- Includes a method to perform the binary search and a main method to demonstrate the search process.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

File: `src/OOPExample.java`

- Demonstrates the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
- Includes a `Person` class with attributes, methods, and constructors.
- Shows how to create objects, call methods, and use getter and setter methods.
